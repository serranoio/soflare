# Soflare

Welcome to Soflare! The plan is to create an open-source Wix/Squarespace alternative.
Also, we plan on exposing an API for any developers to add new frontends!

It currently works locally: with a simple call using a unique name, it deploys frontend onto Netlify and backend with Pocketbase instance
onto Fly.io.

Ask me to demo it!!
